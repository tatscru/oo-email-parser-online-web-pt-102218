# Build a class EmailParser that accepts a string of unformatted 
# emails. The parse method on the class should separate them into
# unique email addresses. The delimiters to support are commas (',')
# or whitespace (' ').

    #here we are initializing a string of emails-- within the class

    email_array = @emails.split(/,\s|\s/).uniq
    # we are parsing emails separated w/ spaces/commas or just spaces if there was not one included. 
    # secondly we are removing any duplicates
